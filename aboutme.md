subtitle: A little bit about me
---
I am from Lyme, New Hampshire where I grew up with my parents and two brothers. When I was young my dad built a skating rink in our backyard, which sparked my passion for ice hockey. Hockey has been a big part of my life and I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to play here at Williams. In my free time, I love playing tennis and golf and taking my golden retriever swimming at the pond.

The reason I am in eTextiles is to get exposure to coding and also learn how to sew. I have minimal sewing experience so I am excited to learn something new. I am a very hands on person so I think I am really going to enjoy the combination of learning code along with phsyically building something. I am very much looking forward to the final project and building something unique.
