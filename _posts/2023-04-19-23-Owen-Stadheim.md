For this assignment I wrote two different functions that emit Morse code to the buzzer. If the the alligator clip circuit is open, the Buzzer will emit Morse code of Owen. If the alligator clip circuit is closed, the Buzzer will emit Morse code of SOS. A tip or trick to my past self would be to make sure my computer is connected to the correct Arduino board.
