For my Final Project, I made a Batman mask that you could wear. When it gets dark out, the two yellow LEDs on the ears of the Batman mask will light up and the buzzer will play the sound Doom. Growing up, my mom would always make homemade costumes for Halloween and I wanted to try something similar with this mask. Also, when I was a kid I had a storm trooper helmet that would play a sounds when a button was pressed. I wanted to create something similar and chose to do a Batman mask because he is my favorite movie character. 

Three tips to myself:
1) Make the mask bigger! I experienced some short circuits because some of my conductive thread was too close together. Making a bigger mask would make it easier to sew the components together without crossing any of the thread.
2) Spend more time planning on how to make the Batman mask look a little more professional because I was too fixated on trying to make the mask work
3) Take more time to sew carefully because some of the connection wasn't very strong because I didn't tighten the conductive thread around the components enough

Materials:
1) 2 yellow Lilypad LEDs
2) Conductive thread
3) Scissors
4) Grey Embroidery Floss
5) Needles
6) 1 Lilypad Buzzer
7) 1 Lilypad Light Sensor
8) 1 battery
9) 1 Lilypad USB Plus
10) 1 Lilypad Switch
