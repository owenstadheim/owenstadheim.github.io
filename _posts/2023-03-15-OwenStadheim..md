For this assignment we had to program 3 sets of the LED lights to flash different patterns. For the first one, we had to code a pattern that would brightly flash for half a second, every 4 seconds,starting at second 0. For the second oen we wrote code that would cause the LED to flash every 3 seconds, starting at second 0, but the flash ould grow brighter every 0.1 seconds until it produced the maximum brightness. For three we wrote the code the LED flashes brightly for 0.2 seconds, within a series of 3 flashes separated by 0.1 seconds, every 10 seconds.
