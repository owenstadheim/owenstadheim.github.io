For this assignment I wrote code that turns on a random PWM pin to a random value every 1 second. If the pin is already on, the code will turn the pin off and if the pin is currently off, then my code will write a random value to it. 
One tip or trick I have for this assignment is to make a seperate variable called random 4. This means that when one of the four pins in the PWM array is chosen, then the corresponding pinState in the pinState array will be chosen. This will make more sense when you look at my code :).
