For this assignment I wrote code that would mimic the behavior of the Plushy assignment by producing outputs that print whether LEDs are on or off depending on if the button and switch were on or off. 

One tip for this assignment is to very carefully look through code when debugging. I had some semicolons absent and didn't have curly brackets in correct places.
