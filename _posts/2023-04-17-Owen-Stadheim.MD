For this assignment I wrote code that will play Star Wars when the switch is in the on position. A tip to my past self when completing this assignment is when I was using code the song, I switch some of the code to stuff we learned in class. This was a tedious task because there were many lines of code. To make this faster you could put the code in google drive and command f the part I was changing.
