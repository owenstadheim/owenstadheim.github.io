The first thing I learned when doing this project is not to break your sewing needle the night the assignment is due. This makes it very difficult to finish. The other is how important attention to detail is when sewing and one tip I have is to put in 45 minutes of work then take a 5 minute break. This allows your brain to take a break and allows you be more focused when you start again.
