For this assignment I wrote code that would print someones meal options depending on if the value stored in the numberchoice is odd. If the value is odd, the person would get to choose from the secret menu. If the number was even, the person would get to choose from the regular menu. 

One tip I have is to make the food items fun, especially on the secret menu. This makes the assigment more fun!
