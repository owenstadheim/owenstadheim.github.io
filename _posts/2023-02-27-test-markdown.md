For this assignment I had to create a paper prototype of a circuit plushy and then put together a real one using three led lights, a battery, a switch, and a button that would turn the lights on. The objective of this project was for the three led lights to turn on when switch was on and the button was pressed.

A tip I have for this assignment is to make sure the LED lights, battery, switch, and button are tightly secured. Also, you must carefully cut the conductive thread because it frays very easily.
