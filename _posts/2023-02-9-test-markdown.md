I am from Lyme, New Hampshire where I grew up with my parents and two brothers. When I was young my dad built a skating rink in our backyard, which sparked my passion for ice hockey. Hockey has been a big part of my life and I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to play here at Williams. For fun, I love to play golf and tennis with my family and play with my dog, Gabe.

How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
