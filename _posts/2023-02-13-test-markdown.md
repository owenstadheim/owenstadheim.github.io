My name is Owen Stadheim and I am a Sophomore. I am a Math and Econ major at Williams. I made a pillow in 5th grade but that is about the extent of my sewing experience. I don't have any programming experience so I am hoping to leave this semester feeling comfortable with the coding with learn in class. One boring fact about me it that I have never broken a bone.
