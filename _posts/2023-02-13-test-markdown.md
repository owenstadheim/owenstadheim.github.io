I am from Lyme, New Hampshire where I grew up with my parents and two brothers. When I was young my dad built a skating rink in our backyard, which sparked my passion for ice hockey. Hockey has been a big part of my life and I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to play here at Williams. In my free time, I love playing tennis and golf and taking my golden retriever swimming at the pond.
